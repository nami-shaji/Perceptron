# Perceptron
Perceptron program conducted at University of Liverpool


Unzip the CA1data.zip folder given in assignment
Place both the train.data and test.data into the directory where the
program is saved.
Example:
Directory for program: \\mfs04\user04\username\Documents
Paste the train.data and test.data to the same directory
\\mfs04\user04\username\Documents\train.data
\\mfs04\user04\username\Documents\test.data

1. Implement a binary perceptron.
2. Use the binary perceptron to train classifiers to discriminate between
•class 1 and class 2,
•class 2 and class 3, and
•class 1 and class 3.
Report the train and test classification accuracies for each of the three classifiers after
training for 20 iterations. Which pair of classes is most difficult to separate?
3. Extend the binary perceptron that you implemented in part 3 above to
perform multi-class classification using the 1-vs-rest approach. Report the train and test
classification accuracies after training for 20 iterations.
4. Add an `2regularisation term to your multi-class classifier implemented in
part 3. Set the regularisation coefficient to 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0 and compare the train
and test classification accuracies.
